## Astrophysics in mars
### Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe. 

## The Astrophysics wing 
### The Astrophysics wing will consist of many diferent rooms wich consist of: four connected greenrooms, washrooms, a public parkish area, 1 person liveing qorters, a biological study room, a lesure center, agreculter area, storage room and a supply closet.

## The 4 conected greenrooms
### (picture)
### The grenn rooms will be lined up. They will have doors conecting them together. There will be a middle seperation chamber inbettwen the different greenrooms. The greenrooms are gradulyesculating from Earths apnissfear to Marses aponessfear. It starts at 100% Earths aponeessfear, then it will become 75% Earths aponessfear and 25% Marses aponessfear. The greenrooms stedly increse like that. There will be glass on the greenroooms so you can look in side so there is glass on the right side of the wall were there is a controll room. that moniters the states of all the greenrooms

## The washroom
### Just a washroom for people in the wing or visting the wing

## The park area and the lesuire area
### The park is a simple room that would look slightly like a hikeing trail but it it can also be used to study in there. Theres a dial at the begging of the room that can let you turn the gravity down for fun and for sience. The park is connected tto the lesure senter wich depending on what can come up a billards tablle, a couch, darts. The lesure senture might have a little mars mussem area because some people like that sort of thing

## The one person liveing qorters
### One or two rooms for one person. The rooms are meant for people who work in the wing. One of the living quorters will be conected to the park and the will be conected to the the hallway.

## The biolgical study room
### The biolgical study room is a sience lab with testing specialtys in bioligy like scalples microscops a glass veiwing area incase we find life. This room is connected to the control room for the greenroooms.

## The agricolter area
### This room is used for growing crops with less gravity its used for experimentation of what we could plant that would be self sastainable on mars.

## The supply closet
### Its used for holding supllys

## The big plan
### The wing needs alll this stuuf because its meant for thhe reacherch of how to teriform mars just practiced in a more controlled inviorment. so everything has its pupose in the wing somemore than others but the extrastras help with mental heath as well as mantaining socialness with others
