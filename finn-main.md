# Navigaiton and geology
## Overview
This wing is divided into rooms and each room has a use, I will be describing each room and why we need it one by one.
### Work bench
The work bench is for tool repair, sample testing and general pysical work. We will need this for geology and maintaining our tools for mining.
### Tools and mining equipment
This is the storage for all the equipment. We need this so we know where the tools are stored and so they are close to the workbench.
### Sample storage
This is the area where the rocks will be stored. We need this so it is close to the workbench and for the storage of metals.
### Drone storage
This area is where we will store drones for use in navigaition of mars. we need the drones for scouting out the planet or other areas (like mines). We need this as a charging station for the drones and for proximity to the computers
### Computer workspace
This is where data will be stored and how we will plan rocket paths and flights. We this will be used for storing geology data. we need this for navigaition of mars and to plan rockets from earth to mars or vice versa.
