# Life Support: more than breathing
If I say "life support" you probably think of a space suit's main function or of the air pressurizing / pee recycling room. But there's so much more to really *thriving* on Mars that nobody seems to remember.

I'm going to leave you in a pod for 20 months. Bye! You have a vat of worms and a standard issue bed. Let me guess: "This sucks." Without a proper environment - one that can be supported and built as well as be physically and mentally healthy - nobody will do well.
One of the jobs of this wing is to find that balance between form and function.
