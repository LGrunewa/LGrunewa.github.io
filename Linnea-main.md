# Life Support
My wing is where we keep spare life support. There's an air pressurizer in every wing - our base will end up quite big - but when they need repairing I'm the person who helps fix them.

# Farming / Cafeteria

Our food supply has to fufill these criteria in order to be viable on Mars.
- Fast turnover of crop
- Able to rebound from crop failure
- Infrequent crop failure
- Easy and efficient to feed
- Shouldnâ€™t require special or heavy equipment
- Able to provide all the nutrients humans need to live

This excludes many kinds of food we have on Earth. Most plants need dirt to live, which is in short supply on other planets. Livestock require a lot of space, food, and time to be worth raising, and long term the investment isn't worth making. There's nothing to forage on Mars either.

One of our first food sources will be insects. The black soldier fly has a fat, oily grub and tame, silent adults. We already do a little bit of soldier fly farming on Earth, and we know how to raise and eat them. The grubs taste like nuts - after all, they have a lot of oil to grow into an adult bug, kind of like how a nut has a lot of oil to grow into an adult tree.
Soldier flies live in plastic bins or vats, and eat sewage. We can save our sewage to feed to the farm! We won't get sick from eating them because of how different flies are to humans. They digest everything dangerous to us, and we get to harvest some of the grubs. which have good balances of vitamin B, fat, iron, calcium, and amino acids.

We won't eat them as-is, though. We can seperate grubs into oil and flour, which allows us to make all sorts of things. We can also send in spices as light cargo with other shipments.

Once we get more established on Mars we can start bringing in other kinds of farms. Hydroponics has come a long way and can help bring variety to the Martian diet by allowing us to grow Earth vegtables and herbs, along with cotton to help replace clothing and sheets. In the hydroponic water we can raise fish, because the fish help plants to grow and the plants help the fish to grow.

# Dormitories
The dormitories form the upper floor of my wing. They're next to each other, with all the rooms being hexagons. Hexagons save the most material when the walls are being built, and are easy to direct a 3D printer to build.
Most of the dormitories are in one place. This keeps people close together and talking, which can be the difference between someone going crazy and hiding in their locked wings and a sane person.

Inside, the lighting is LED. LEDs save a lot of energy because of how they work  - they don't need to heat up in order to glow, saving all of that heat energy. We also won't need to account for lighting in our HVAC. LEDs come in lots of fun colors, and we can have our lights be a dance party for all of our Mars rave dreams.

The furniture will be 3D printed, to save cargo space.
