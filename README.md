# LGrunewa.github.io
## The Official Mars Project Website


### Some rules

- Try not to use any of the pages for sandboxing. Errors are fine but keep blatant gobbledegook to the LinneaGrunewald.github.io sandbox repository.
- Name your files with the proper file extension and without spaces or special characters.
- Don't touch anything you didn't create unless you have permission.
- Give a description of what you did when commiting changes. Try to make it unique - "link fix" could refer to any link on the page. This makes rollbacking and organization easier.

### Other

- Imperius is still watching. From far away he chews his popcorn, waiting for enlightenment in Markdown. Help him out by going to the Google Doc How To Use Github and adding questions, comments, and concerns. You can brush up on your Markdown while helping the poor Roman out. Maybe one day he'll have a repository of his own and won't need to watch us anymore.
- By the way, Imperius is also a test image. He's useful as well as watchful.
