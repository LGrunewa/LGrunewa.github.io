# Medical Wing
## Overview
The medical wing of our settlement is made up of 3 main components, which are as follows: med bay, biology/research laboratories, and the fitness and exercise centers. All of these elements are crucial in maintaing the wellbeing of our astronauts and citizens throughout the revolutionary journey. As is obvious, the med bay contains the most important sections of this wing, containing technologies, treaments and medications that will be used for both first aid and regular care. Labs are key for discovering and monitoring the effects of microgravity and martian conditions on the human body, which is a main area of research during this mission. Finally, the fitness section of our annexe prevents further deterioration of systems in the body, maintaining the health of all residents. 

### Known effects of microgravity and space travel on humans
|Common effects| Rare effects (worst case scenarios) |
|---|---|
|Puffiness in face and 10%-30% decrease in leg circumfrence| Kidney Stones|
|Nasal stuffiness and/or eye abnormalities| Increased risk of cancer |
|Reduction of red blood cells | Increased risk of osteoporis-related fractures|
|Profound muscle atrophy| Affected hand-eye and head-eye coordiantion issues, along with problems involving spatial awareness and balance |
|Demineralization of skeleton/decrease in bone density (osteopenia)| Increased risk of depression |
|Motion sickness/disorientation| Radiation sickness (characterized by nausea, vomiting, anorexia and fatigue) |
|Shallow or disturbed sleep cycles| Possibel damge to the nervous system, causing altered cognitive function, reduced motor function and behavioral changes|

### Dangers to citizen/astronaut safety 
#### Space Radiation
Space radiation is a huge threat to the wellfare of human beings, causing (as shown above) radiation sickeness, along with an increased risk of cancer. This radiation comes in 3 main forms: particles trapped in Earth's magnetic field, particles shot into space during solar flares, and galatic cosmic rays (a mix of high-energy protons and heavy ions from outside of our solar system. This radiation comes from many sources, such as elements in Earth's crust, stars and other astrophysical objects, but the main culprit is our Sun. The flaming ball of gas emits all 7 wavelngths of the elctromagnetic spectrum (radiowaves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays). During a soalr flare,copious amounts of radiation is released (called a solar particle event, or an SPE) in the forms of x-rays, gamma rays, protons and electrons.
One very common measurement for radiation is a milli-sievert, and astronauts are exposed to an average of 50 mSv to 2,000 mSv, a dangerous amount equilvalent to 150 to 6,000 chest x-rays (1,000 mSv causes fatal cancer in 5% of people). 

#### Spacesuit malfunctions
The spacesuits generally used for EVA (extravehicular activities) are called EMUs (Extravehicular mobility units). These  bulky, white uncomfortable suits have a long way to go for form, yet still provide constant life support thrughout an expidition, along wth atmospheric containment, thermal insulation, cooling, soalr radiation protection, and protecting from micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). They are maintained at a slightly lower pressure than the ISS. Malfunctions here are rare but can be incredibly hazardous, if not fatal, to the person wearing it.
